title: More Github/ Github actions
---

For this blog post, I plan on discussing the following topics:

1. Why the git push was not working with my github account in R studio
2. Pull request for Github actions
3. What I will be working on next
4. References

# Why the git push was not working with my github account in R studio

Look at this [link](https://superuser.com/questions/1064197/how-to-switch-git-user-at-terminal). Essentially. I had to go to Control Panel, Users Accounts, Credential Manager, then Windows Credentials and just delete the github credentials. From here, I just needed to ad my github account again.

# Pull request for Github actions

I did not have to do anything here because on the `docker-image.yml`, it took into account for the pull request. Essentially, when I pushed my code, I saw a highlighted bar saying whether I wanted to compare and make a pull request with the main branch(Note: I made a new branch in R and wanted to merge it).

Other than that, here are some of the commands I used in R studio terminal:

```
git branch --list
git checkout -b test-branch
git config --global --list
```

# What I will be working on next

So what I will be working on next and sort of right now is what kind of stuff I want to put on the R shiny dashboard.

Here are a couple things I probably would want to put on the dashboard:

* Racial dot map
* Real Estate map(selecting a certain house range, baths, garage, rooms, etc.)
* School rating, What kind of corporations are located in the area, maybe a comparison of home prices by year
* Some Analysis: Statistical models, Machine Learning models(predictions/classifications)
* Some use of an API
* User login
* Stripe/Paypal option
* Database options
* etc.
