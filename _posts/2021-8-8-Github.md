title: More Github/ Github actions

For this blog post, I plan on discussing the following topics:

1. Why the git push was not working with my github account in R studio
2. Pull request for Github actions
3. What I will be working on next
4. References

# Why the git push was not working with my github account in R studio

# Pull request for Github actions

# What I will be working on next

So what I will be working on next and sort of right now is what kind of stuff I want to put on the R shiny dashboard.

Here are a couple things I probably would want to put on the dashboard:

* Racial dot map
* Real Estate map(selecting a certain house range, baths, garage, rooms, etc.)
* School rating, What kind of corporations are located in the area, maybe a comparison of home prices by year
* Some Analysis: Statistical models, Machine Learning models(predictions/classifications)
* Some use of an API
* User login
* Stripe/Paypal option
* Database options
* etc.
